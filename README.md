"Hello, World!" [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) app, written in Python, using [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/). Tested with Github actions and pytest. Also test that the `.py` files are [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatted.

Heroku is [set up](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#enabling-github-integration) to build and deploy the project when changes are pushed to the `main` GitHub branch, if the tests carried out by GitHub actions pass.
